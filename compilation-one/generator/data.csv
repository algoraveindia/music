Past/Lives,Nanditi,Avani,https://editor.p5js.org/Avani11/full/mA_T4NS10,"I usually begin a new track with a wish — to time-travel to a place, a moment, or memory. Or to invite someone into an inner landscape of feeling. For me, music is about evoking atmosphere. A journey — through space and time, or deep within.
This piece - Past/Lives - began when I recently revisited the music school I went to as a child, hidden within Jaipur’s historic walled city. In the courtyard stood a massive banyan tree — my favourite spot during breaks. From there, a whole world of sound unfolded: echoes of riyaaz, tabla, kathak, voices drifting from jharokhas, birds, wind, children playing. A soundscape alive with emotion and memory.
I also imagined the sounds that came before me — court musicians, ancient forts, centuries of ragas echoing across time. This track became a sonic drift through both personal and imagined pasts — a quiet thanks to my gurus, and to the traditions still humming in the walls.
Composed entirely in code on Sonic Pi, the piece layers field recordings, snippets of my own singing, and generative melodies based on Raag Darbari. The tabla, in Ektal, is coded too — where rhythm and recursion move together effortlessly. The cyclical nature of taal fits naturally into the logic of code. This is how I think, feel, and make music: with raga as my root system, code as my co-composer, and Sonic Pi as my instrument — electronic music, grounded in the classical.
When Avani and I began working on the zine, I shared the story behind the track — and she was immediately drawn to the memory of listening beneath the banyan tree. That moment became our starting point. The zine extends that atmosphere visually.
Camaraderie and joy in collaboration are central to our practice, so we nodded to our shared heritage by using Ajrakh motifs in the generative elements and colour palette — drawn from traditions that belong to us both.
The idea of listening to life around you — and the life that once was — resonated deeply. In the final poster of the zine, we tried to hold space for that layered listening and left the viewer with a quiet prompt to find their own.","https://www.instagram.com/nanditi.k/

hyperbole_samosa,Roguentropy,Sameera,https://editor.p5js.org/sameera.mudgal4/full/dzac-NS5X,"Hyperbole samosa is an ode to two things I love that are absurdly different from each other: nature and memes. i always wanted this piece to have both these aspects come together in a track. it starts as a hyberbole with extended samples and streched hi-hats, segues into an interlude sample which i wanted to call ""samosa"" (just because), and ends with a chill electronic segment with breakbeat for posture.

The quirky samples in Hyperbole samosa made me ping Roguentropy for a collaboration. Fortunately right in our first conversation, I resonated with how he described the chill-electronic genre of this track, with a bit of dreamy,organic predisposition, and I knew I wanted to recreate this vibe in visuals. Two popping elements in the track were birds and samosas. So I experimented with patterns and movements, mixed with company-style bird paintings of India in the Colonial era. I also gravitated towards mythological representation of birds as a provocation juxtaposed with Roguentropy's take on AI, which is meant to be ephemeral and hilarious.",https://soundcloud.com/roguentropy,https://sameeramudgal4.wixsite.com/sameeramudgal,"Sangarshanan is a Software Engineer from planet Earth who loves  building stuff that helps and amuses him in equal measure.

ashlands,the winterscapes,Mangesh,https://editor.p5js.org/mkangesh29/full/VCLdvczx1,"The name ""the winterscapes"" started from a purpose to capture sounds of a time, sounds of a place through imagination and deliberation. Lamenting what has been and what will come to be is somewhat self-inflicting but as this is largely becoming the direction of the pieces, I am finding the lament to be the debt paid for a better tomorrow. This particular piece, ashlands, occurs in world of permanent storms, a place struggling after an era of errors of our ways. In the pain, sorrow and confusion, there are tones of people looking for what is right and what is meaninig for them. I started this piece with all the elements I wanted to portray and layered them out.

infract[ion],Spiralynk,Sushma,https://editor.p5js.org/sushmaj/full/6n1T2G5a_,"infract[ion] is an exploration of organised chaos by Spiralynk. It is a sonic system intentionally fractured from within.

Constructed using a hybrid approach featuring procedural audio and neural synthesis, the piece leverages glitchy percussive structures, unstable tonal fragments, and machine-learnt textures generated using variational autoencoders (VAEs) and timbre transfer models. These elements are shaped by code, not performance, until they’re fractured again.

Although the source materials emerge from non-repeating, algorithmically generated processes, curated excerpts of machine-generated audio were restructured, reintroducing form without sacrificing the inherent volatility of the generative system. The track exists in tension: between structure and collapse, determinism and entropy, listening and parsing.

The title, infract[ion], references a conceptual and architectural breach: a localised rupture indexed within a broader system. The square brackets suggest modularity, selection, and controlled deviation. It’s a signal that this rupture is not accidental. It is chosen, framed, and composed.

This work forms part of the broader Fractured Neurons project, a research-driven audio practice investigating procedural composition, AI-generated timbre, and the performability of machine learning in contemporary sound art.

Taal Summit,Trophallaxis,Roshini,https://editor.p5js.org/satyarth/full/DqhplVTv0,"Satyarth: When I set out to make a track for this compilation, I wanted to make something that highlights aspects of livecoding that set it apart from more traditional music production methods and decided to focus on playing with time. My main livecoding tool is Tidal Cycles, which takes a cyclical approach to time that it happens to share with Indian classical music. Within a time cycle, the taal determines how the cycle is subdivided into evenly spaced chunks. What I ended up with is a composition that takes a fixed time cycle and progresses through different numbers of divisions, from 1 up to the summit of 16 and then back down to 1. So it's a kind of journey through different taals, seamlessly cycling through them in a way that I think it'd be very hard for human musicians to do. I'm a tabla player, I've been learning for about 6 years now, and diving into the intricacies of Indian classical rhythms has been a very exciting journey. My guruji Ashish Mishra, who's always encouraging me to be a sound explorer even beyond the context of classical music, has been my biggest inspiration here, and the vocal samples in the intro and ending are from recordings of our classes.",http://satyarth.me/trophallaxis/,Fill me in!,"Satyarth Mishra Sharma is a researcher, musician, and visual artist based in Moscow.

D:$!n+e(-),beatnyk,Abhishek Kapahi,https://editor.p5js.org/abhikapahi/full/okdDcs7Nq,"I wish there was a procedural thought. I simply wanted to make a banger with chaotic drum patterns glued to some melody/bassline. My initial draft was all over the place, reigning absolute chaos, whereas the second iteration tamed it down. The third hit the sweet spot, but it still felt like it needed a lot of work to make it tighter or less repetitive. My iterations after that made the track either go longer or changed the entire mood. So, I came back to my nearly done third iteration again and finalized it for this compilation.

For the zine, well, I had to cook something up because, again, there was no thought beyond wanting a banger for a track. So, after listening to the chaos I made and the inner peace I crave, I boiled down the track's idea to just that. After having a conversation with Abhishek, we figured it’d be interesting to juxtapose it with a rat race but symbolically play with fishes (because my crazy brain stylized the name with special characters that made it look like a fish). Abhishek put together the zine's design, playing with the chaos of a toxic workplace and the idea of fishes (metaphorically us) being infected by the toxicity. We played with words that relate to us when we think of chaos or toxic culture and our inner urge to fight back.

The code/poetry is an idea that came out of this practice of creating with code. While it carries certain elements from a formal programming language, it is a basic poem that talks one through the chaos and the need for peace. It also speaks about the process of iterations and repetition, which played a major role in this collaboration.

Disinfect, or D:$!n+(-), is a track that solely drives the listener through a catchy tune and unrhythmic drum grooves before leaving them with an abrupt silence, releasing the listener from the grips of chaos.
