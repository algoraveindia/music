                      Spiralynk is the alias of Ankit Malik, an interdisciplinary artist, creative technologist, and researcher working at the intersection of sound, code, and machine intelligence. His work spans algorithmic composition, neural audio synthesis, immersive sound design, and generative audio-reactive visuals. His current practice explores real-time sonic systems powered by neural networks, developing new approaches to human-computer interaction and procedural audio.

He has performed across the UK, Europe, and India, with appearances at Magnetic Fields Festival, Reset Networks, Goethe-Institut, and Algorave India, and has composed for experimental theatre and multimedia works in Cambridge, Prague, and Kolkata.

Ankit has consulted on Acoustic Vehicle Alerting Systems and Sonic Interaction Design in the automotive industry and co-founded the media collective Bonafide Seven. He holds a Master of Music from Berklee College of Music and bachelor's degrees from Anglia Ruskin University and St. Xavier’s College, Kolkata.

                      Sushma is an artist and educator who enjoys combining various mediums in unusual ways to create moments of delight. They observe the world deeply, obsessively document everyday life, and dream of a gentle world. Their creations often revolve around ordinary found objects, transforming them into whimsical works of art.

                    infract[ion] is an exploration of organised chaos by Spiralynk. It is a sonic system intentionally fractured from within.

Constructed using a hybrid approach featuring procedural audio and neural synthesis, the piece leverages glitchy percussive structures, unstable tonal fragments, and machine-learnt textures generated using variational autoencoders (VAEs) and timbre transfer models. These elements are shaped by code, not performance, until they’re fractured again.

Although the source materials emerge from non-repeating, algorithmically generated processes, curated excerpts of machine-generated audio were restructured, reintroducing form without sacrificing the inherent volatility of the generative system. The track exists in tension: between structure and collapse, determinism and entropy, listening and parsing.

The title, infract[ion], references a conceptual and architectural breach: a localised rupture indexed within a broader system. The square brackets suggest modularity, selection, and controlled deviation. It’s a signal that this rupture is not accidental. It is chosen, framed, and composed.

This work forms part of the broader Fractured Neurons project, a research-driven audio practice investigating procedural composition, AI-generated timbre, and the performability of machine learning in contemporary sound art.
